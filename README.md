- 👋 Hi, I’m @michaelmalonenz
- 👀 I’m interested in programming languages, web development, productive teams, and linux
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to write a programming language interpreter
- 💞️ I’m not looking to collaborate - I get paid to do that at work, this stuff is easy because I get to just make decisions and not have messy interactions with other people.
- 📫 How to reach me you can tweet me: @michaelmalonenz
